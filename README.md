# Text2TreeTool

## Overview

This tool is developed with C# and the WPF Framework, compatible with Windows OS. Users can describe attack trees (AT's) in a modified tab-delimited syntax, and perform cost-analysis to evaluate the cost of the most and least costly routes within the tree.

## Specification
-Programming language: C#\
-.NET 8.0 \
-UI framework: Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)\
-Libraries: Syncfusion


## Features
-CRUD operations on Attack Trees \
-Parse tab-delimited text into visual AT/ADT's\
-Display AND/OR logic\
-Append weights to each node \
-Cost-analysis\
-Import (.txt)\
-Export (PNG, GIF, JPEG, BMP, WDP, TIFF)\
-Print the AT\
-Save

## How to get started
1. Ensure your system meets the minimum requirements: Windows OS and .NET 8.0
2. Download the ZIP file containing the application source code
3. For all Syncfusion components to work it is essential to  generate a license key from https://help.syncfusion.com/common/essential-studio/licensing/licensing-faq/where-can-i-get-a-license-key   
4. Extract and open the file within an IDE that supports C# and WPF, such as Visual Studio
5. Place the license key in the App.xaml.cs file where it states "Insert your license key here"
6. As the project uses multiple syncfusion components, ensure the required ones are included - VS typically restores the packages automatically once the project is built. Or you can restore them using the NuGet Package Manager
